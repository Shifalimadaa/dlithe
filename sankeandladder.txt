write a program to implement sanke and ladder for the given snake and ladder board.
s(score)=8 {add 14}=22
        =27{add 26}=53
        =42{    26}=68
        =61{    30}=91
        =75{    20}
s=97{sub 80}  
s=92{    60}
s=74{    34}=40
s=56{    30}=26
s=23{    16}=7
Step 1:Assign p1=0,p2=0 and read player number
Step 2:Gennrate a random number between 1 to 6
Step 3:Add random nuber to the player score
step 4:Check if any snake or ladder
Step 5:Check if player score=100
Step 6:then declare th player as the winner and stop execution
Step 7:Check if player score>100 then reduce the random number from the        player score
step 8:Repeat step p2  

To print all possible substring in the given strin
